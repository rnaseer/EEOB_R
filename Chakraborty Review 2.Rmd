Hi Rasba, your overall code looks great. Here are some feedback

1. Data inspection
Good use of libraries like tidyverse, dplyr, and RColorBrewer which are essential for data manipulation and visualization.
Efficient initial data inspection using dim(), file.info(), and sum(is.na()) to understand the dataset's structure and cleanliness.
Consider adding stringsAsFactors = FALSE to avoid unintended factor conversion.

2. Data processing
The subsetting and transposition steps are well-organized and appropriately executed.
Good use of looping for processing and exporting chromosome-specific data.

3. Data visuakization:
Creative use of ggplot2 for diverse data visualization types, showcasing an excellent grasp of the package's capabilities.
Effective data transformation with pivot_longer() to prepare data for visualization.
Adding more detailed titles, axis labels, and legends to the plots can significantly enhance interpretability.

Overall, the script demonstrates solid data manipulation and visualization skills. The author has shown proficiency in using R for detailed genetic data analysis.
